# Digital Passport using BlockChain Technology

Applying for a new passport takes a lot of time and includes a long procedure. If the passport is gone it will be very difficult to get it again. These procedures may take a few days sometimes more than a week. This problem can be avoided by using 'Digitial Passport'.

Digital Passports are created by the secured data of the user and it uses 'BlockChain' technology through which information will be stored in each block and can be retrieved easily even if the passport is gone.

Each user will be given an individual public key which is used in the blocks to store the log files of the particular citizen passport.So in any circumstance if the passport is misplaced it can be easily recovered as the log file of that particular citizen is present in every system in the network pool.

A unique QR code is given for every digital passport so for validation of the passport the person can scan the QR code and can check the validation of the Digital Passport.

## Algorithm:

### Step 1: Photo of a Citizen

A passport size photo of the enrolling citizen has to be taken using a webcam.

### Step 2: Merkle Root

Merkle Root is obtained either from blockchain.info , insight.bitpay.com

### Step 3: Block Number
A block number corresponding to the generated merkle root from above step is taken.

### Step 4: Timestamp

The current time (i.e.  the time of generating the digital passport) is taken and added to the digital passport.According to this time stamp an expiry date to the digital passport is given.

### Step 5: Name

The full name of the citizen is taken as input and added to the digital passport.

### Step 6: PGP key

The citizen is provided with a laptop and is taken to a private room and using an PGP software they will generate a PGP key which acts as a private key and it will be a secret key and will be present only with the citizen.

### Step 7: Authentication Service

It is done using keybase.io website. Using this an QR code is generated and can be given to every user uniquely.
